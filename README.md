# PSBT Transaction File Utilities

## üìù README

This repository provides a set of tools and a library for handling Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) files. PSBT is a standard (BIP 174) for exchanging Bitcoin transactions between different wallets and services to facilitate the construction of a transaction.

### What is a PSBT?

A Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction (PSBT) is a data format that allows different parties to collaborate on a single Bitcoin transaction without revealing their private keys to one another. This is particularly useful for:

  * **Multi-signature wallets:** Multiple signers can add their signatures to a transaction independently.
  * **Hardware wallets:** A hardware wallet can receive an unsigned transaction, sign it, and return it without ever exposing the private key to the host computer.
  * **CoinJoin:** Multiple parties can cooperate to create a single transaction to enhance privacy.

A PSBT file contains all the necessary information for a transaction, including the unsigned transaction, input data (UTXOs), and fields for signatures. Each party involved can add their part and pass it on to the next.

### Key Features

  * **Parsing and Serialization:** Read and write PSBT files in their Base64 format.
  * **Transaction Building:** Create a new PSBT from a list of inputs and outputs.
  * **Signature Handling:** Add signatures (e.g., from a hardware wallet) to a PSBT.
  * **PSBT Combination:** Merge multiple PSBTs into a single, comprehensive PSBT. This is essential for multi-party signing workflows.
  * **Finalization:** Finalize a PSBT once all signatures are collected, preparing it for broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
  * **Validation:** Validate the integrity and correctness of a PSBT.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8+
  * pip

#### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PSVikki/Multisig.git
    cd psbt-tools
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage Examples

#### 1\. Creating a Basic PSBT

```python
from psbt_lib import PSBT, Input, Output
from bitcoin_lib import P2PKHOutput, UTXO

# Assume you have a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) to spend
utxo = UTXO(txid="abcdef123456...", vout=0, script_pubkey="...")

# Create the output
recipient_address = "1H4tD16pMy544aA8QE3b19wzEmzwJn3wtf"
amount_btc = 68.93732413 BTC
output = P2PKHOutput(amount_btc, recipient_address)

# Create the PSBT
psbt = PSBT.create(inputs=[utxo], outputs=[output])

# Export to Base64 format
base64_psbt = psbt.to_base64()
print(base64_psbt)
```

#### 2\. Signing and Finalizing a PSBT

This example assumes you have a private key for the input. In a real-world scenario, this might be handled by a hardware wallet.

```python
from psbt_lib import PSBT

# Load a PSBT from a file or string
with open("unsigned.psbt", "r") as f:
    psbt_str = f.read()

unsigned_psbt = PSBT.from_base64(psbt_str)

# Add the signature (this is a simplified example)
signed_psbt = unsigned_psbt.sign_with_private_key("your_private_key_here")

# Finalize the transaction
finalized_psbt = signed_psbt.finalize()

# Extract the final transaction and broadcast
final_tx = finalized_psbt.extract_transaction()
# Code to broadcast final_tx to the network...
```

#### 3\. Combining Two PSBTs

```python
from psbt_lib import PSBT

# Load two partially signed PSBTs
with open("signer1.psbt", "r") as f:
    psbt1 = PSBT.from_base64(f.read())

with open("signer2.psbt", "r") as f:
    psbt2 = PSBT.from_base64(f.read())

# Combine them
combined_psbt = psbt1.combine(psbt2)

# Now, the combined_psbt has all the signatures and can be finalized
finalized_psbt = combined_psbt.finalize()
```

### The PSBT File Format

PSBT files are typically Base64-encoded binary data. The internal structure is a key-value map, where each key identifies a specific part of the transaction (e.g., a specific input, a witness script, or a signature). Our tools handle the encoding and decoding of this format for you.
